Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game played on a 3×3 grid. Players take turns placing their symbols, X and O, into empty boxes on the board. The objective is to be the first player to form a straight line of three matching symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The game automatically checks for a winner after every move and displays a message when a player wins. If all boxes are filled and no winning pattern is formed, the game results in a draw. A Reset / New Game option allows players to restart the game and play again without reloading the page.

This project demonstrates basic concepts of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for game logic and DOM manipulation, making it a great beginner-friendly interactive web game.
